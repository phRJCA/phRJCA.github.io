    <p>Hi! I'm Reynald Albano, and I made this site for practice. For everything. Though content's mostly for Japan.</p>
    <p>Everywhere, if you see someone with a username "RJCA" or "phRJCA", that's probably me.</p>
    <p>If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to message me on Facebook on that site below.</p>
    <p>You can see my other accounts here:</p>
